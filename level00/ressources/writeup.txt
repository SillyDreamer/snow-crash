Look for any file owned by user flag00 and hide error output by redirecting it to /dev/null.

find / -user flag00 2>/dev/null
/usr/sbin/john
/rofs/usr/sbin/john

cat /usr/sbin/john
cdiiddwpgswtgt

This password doesnt work, we need to decrypt this
We try to decrypt it using the ROT alghoritm at https://www.dcode.fr/chiffre-rot
We see that ROT15 gives us "nottoohardhere"

su flag00
nottoohardhere
get flag
Check flag. Here is your token: x24ti5gi3x0ol2eh4esiuxias
