We decided to check all the users in the system so we `cat /etc/passwd`
In passwd file we spotted that flag01 user has string instead of x ('42hDRfypTqqnw'), some googling gave us that usually passwords stored hashed in shadow file,
but it also may be stored in passwd file.

More googling and we found out that simple hashes may be brute forced via JohnTheRipper utility
sudo apt-get install john
put password hash in file and run john on it
john file_with_hash
it gives us unsiphered password
>42hDRfypTqqnw:abcdefg
su flag01
>abcdefg
getflag
>f2av5il02puano7naaf6adaaf
